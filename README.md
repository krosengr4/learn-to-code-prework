# Learn To Code Prework
## Python, Java, Go

### Description
This repository contains the prework assignments from Year Up United's Learn to Code prework course. Originally taught and completed using python, but solved the exercises using other languages. The purpose of this is for practice writing code for programming languages that I am jbrand new to learn, and getting practice with the fundamentals of the language by writing basic, beginner-level code.
